<h3>The Pursuit of Happyness</h3>
<p>
  I love the ups and downs in the movie. A struggling salesman who never gives
  up in trying to find true happiness for himself and his son.
</p>

<h3>Spirted Away</h3>
<p>
  This is a great anime about a girl wandering a world ruled by witches and
  spirts, where humans are changed into animals.
</p>

<h3>Soul</h3>
<p>
  Joe, a middle school band teacher feels unfulfilled because of his ambitions
  to be a full-time jazz musician. On the day he lands the biggest gig of his
  life, he nearly dies - but then gets the chance to return to his body if he
  can figure out the purpose in his life.
